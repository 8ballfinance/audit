RugDoc Review

Fullsail fork with early harvest bonus very similar to Polyce and Polypingu.

Each farm pool has a setting to determine if it gets 15% reward for users who stake early. This reward lasts for 604800 blocks, which is about 14 days on Polygon.
Deposit fees capped at 4%.
8BALL token has a 1% burn fee that can be turned on or off (currently off). Staking will subtract 1% from userâ€™s balance regardless.
Not setup yet (no pools have been added) and not under timelock, so check interactions.
